# TODO

This captures some of the tasks to be done. The intention is to keep it updated, but may not happen. Feel free to make suggestions here.


* Security code - enhance the code generation to handle different security schemas. Currently, it only handles an API key.
* Additional examples - helps with diversity of OAS methods
* Hooks to tie into manual CLI code
* Option to generate API layer - returns the server result instead of parsing/displaying result. The idea would be something used in more involved testing.
